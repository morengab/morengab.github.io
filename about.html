                <p>Hi, I'm Gaby — I’m a Design Principal at IBM, working on IBM Cloud and leading design for our global portfolio of cloud-native, hybrid cloud solutions. I really enjoy designing developer-oriented experiences and generally thrive in highly technical domains.</p>
                <p>Over the last few years, I’ve gotten the chance to work across the full product lifecycle, from idea to launch, growth and even deprecation! Some of the products I’ve helped ship are IBM Cloud Satellite, IBM Schematics, and Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud. I’ve also worked on existing services such as IBM Kubernetes Service, Observability, and DevOps tools. The first product I designed for, IBM Cloud Foundry, is actually now being deprecated — as people adopt some of the newer services I’ve helped ship. Talk about full circle!</p>
                <p>My design work has earned multiple international awards and recognitions, such as a Red Dot: Best of the Best, a Good Design Award,  BIG Awards for Business: Product of the Year and multiple IBM Outstanding Technical Achievements.</p>
                <p>I speak locally, nationally, and internationally at conferences such as KubeCon+CloudNativeCon Europe & North America, SXSW Interactive, and the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing, where I enjoy speaking to both designer and developer audiences.</p>
                <p>As former Co-Lead of the Kubernetes Special Interest Group for Usability, I enjoy mentoring designers, researchers, and developers alike from companies such as the Linux Computing Foundation, Google, VMware, and Microsoft on how to contribute to open source.</p>
                <p>I studied computer science at the University of Pennsylvania and have my Master's in Human Computer Interaction from Carnegie Mellon University.</p>
